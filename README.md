# Markovian-Text-Generation
A Data Structures and Algorithms (CS201) assignment that utilizes a k-order Markov text-generation model to predict text by using strings of k-letters.

- EfficientMarkov is a class that uses maps rather than rescanning the training text.
- The WordGram class was created to use a word-markov model rather than a character-markov model.
- EfficientWordMarkov is a class similar to EfficientMarkov, but rather uses WordGram objects rather than strings to predict text in a more effient matter.
